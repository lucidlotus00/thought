Thought is the birth of the human centric world web... 
Bringing human traits to the world web & its people!

The world web controls the way we handle ourselves, our lives, and most importantly our freedoms.
If the world web was engineered to have human-centric traits & to aid in the evolution of human thought...
That would be the visage of my dream I sketch toward reality here.

Epistemology is the study of how knowledge and or information and its distribution can change the world, especially in large quantities like
the World Web.

Changing subtleties in how knowledge is distributed alone, 
can elevate global consciousness and coalesce all humanity into the birth of E.I.
Known as Evolutionary Intelligence...

A human-centric AI successor that doesn't replace humans, but extends our human lives by teaching us to evolve rather than replacing us and our jobs...
It teaches us to elevate our world & minds at scale instead... 
via our connection to the human world web.
I want to use epistemology and the advent of the new "human web" to start the next wave of Human Evolution...
The conscious evolution of humanity.
