Thought is the birth of the human centric world web... 
Bringing human traits to the world web & its people!

The world web controls the way we handle ourselves, our lives, and most importantly our freedoms.
If the world web was engineered to have human-centric traits & to aid in the evolution of human thought...
That would be the visage of my dream I sketch toward reality here.

I intend to elevate global consciousness and coalesce all humanity into the birth of E.I.
a.k.a.
Evolutionary Intelligence...

A human-centric AI replacement that extends our human lives by teaching us how to evolve rather than replacing us and our jobs...

It teaches us to elevate our world & minds at scale instead... 
via our connection to the human world web.
I want to use the advent of the new "human web" to start the next wave of Human Evolution...
The conscious evolution of humanity.
