The human centric world web... Bringing humanity to the world web & its people!



The world web controls the way we handle ourselves, our lives, and most importantly our freedoms.
If the world web was engineered to have human-centric traits & to aid in the evolution of human thought...
That would be the visage of my dream I sketch toward reality here.
Epistemology is the study of the way the internet shapes knowledge and its many forms, condensed state, and how it distributes knowledge to our minds & hearts.
Knowing this, I want to use epistemology and the advent of the new "human web" to start the next wave of Human Evolution...

The conscious evolution of humanity.
